*Books app with A and B versions* 

If a user clicks the 'Download PDF' button, the app sends data to Amplitude so we know the number of users that clicked the button for each version.

## Build & Run

If you want to run the app on your development machine, you'll need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Follow these steps to get the app running on your machine:
- Click on the green 'Code' button in the repository's page and copy the URL in the text field that pops up.   
- Open the command line terminal on your computer.
- Run `git clone https://github.com/configcat-labs/ab-testing-nextJS-amplitude-sample.git`.
- Navigate into the folder 'ab-testing-nextJS-amplitude-sample'.
- Run `npm run dev`.

The app should now be running on localhost:3000. Open up localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.
